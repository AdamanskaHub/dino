This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is i?

I'm trying to make a virtual coach with whom you bond as a you keep doing your tasks. It can be used for studying and/or working out, or anything else if you want.

I'm doing this as a side project, doing design, illustration (except the background) and code.

This is what it looks like so far :)
